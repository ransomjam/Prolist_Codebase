Build a Professional Services marketplace in ProList that includes:

1. Professional Services Page (/src/pages/ProfessionalServices.jsx)
Shows the 5 core online services as clickable cards:

Graphic Design & Branding

Video Editing & Production

Website Design & Development

Resume/CV Writing & Career Coaching

Data Analysis & Visualization

Each card includes a service icon, short description, and neon hover effect.

Clicking a service filters the professional providers list below by category.

The professionals list shows dummy providers with:

Name, photo, rating/trust badge, short bio

Button to view professional profile

Button to chat (in-app)

The professional cards should have a ‚ÄúHire‚Äù button linking to the checkout flow for escrow-protected service purchase.

2. Signup Page Update (/src/pages/Signup.jsx)
Add ‚ÄúProfessional Service Provider‚Äù user type.

When selected, show dropdown to choose from the 5 core services.

Save user type and service category to user profile on signup.

3. Professional Profile Page (/src/pages/ProfessionalProfile.jsx)
Show professional‚Äôs name, photo, verified badge, trust score.

Display service category and detailed bio/portfolio.

List of services offered (dummy data).

In-app chat button.

‚ÄúHire Now‚Äù button linking to checkout page.

4. Checkout Page (/src/pages/Checkout.jsx)
Same escrow workflow as listings checkout:

Show service details, price.

Select payment method (MTN, Orange Money, CPP).

Confirm order stores order with escrow status.

Redirect to order confirmation page.

5. Order Confirmation Page
Confirms order received and payment held in escrow.

Explains next steps (service delivery, buyer confirmation).

Link to track orders.

6. Order Tracking & Confirmation Pages
Buyer sees active orders, confirms delivery, uploads proof photo.

Vendor sees orders, marks service delivered.

Admin releases escrow funds and updates sales count.

7. In-App Chat Integration
Chat component for buyers and providers to communicate before/during service.

Real-time or simulated chat using React state or Firebase.

8. Design & UI
Use Tailwind CSS with neon color palette consistent with ProList branding.

Responsive layouts, clean typography, smooth animations.

Use appropriate icons for services and trust badges.
